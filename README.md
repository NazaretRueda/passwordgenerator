# passwordgenerator



## Description

As part of this activity, we will create a web application that generates random passwords according to the following criteria.

- The length of the password:
    At least 8 characters but no more than 128.

- Character types:
    Lowercase
    Uppercase
    Numeric
    Special characters ($@%&*, etc)

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the application of the learned knowledge of JavaScript by using different arrays and executing functions that allow us to create and validate a number of conditions.
We have used HTML and JavaScript to construct a dynamic user interface in this example.
